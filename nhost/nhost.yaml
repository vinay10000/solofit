    # Note: You'll need logic inside the function (or separate functions)
    # to know WHICH type ('DAILY', 'WEEKLY', 'SEASONAL') to generate based on the trigger.
    # A simple way is separate function endpoints (e.g., /generate-daily, /generate-weekly)
    # or passing a query parameter/body payload if using webhooks.
    # For this example, the function currently defaults to 'DAILY'.
    # You would need to modify the function to accept a type parameter.

  # Run seasonal mission generation on the 1st of Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct at 00:15 UTC
  generateSeasonalMissions:
    schedule: '15 0 1 1,4,7,10 *' # 15 mins past midnight UTC on 1st day of Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct
